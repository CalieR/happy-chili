Back in the late 90’s there was mass panic over the 'Millenium Bug’ — worry spread over how computers would cope at the turn of the century…when the calendar turned over to Jan 1st 2000, would planes really drop out of the sky?

Now we’re being warned of a possible new threat — on January 19th 2038, we could be waking up to another technological meltdown.

<figcaption>Time is a construct</figcaption>

If time isn’t real, how are digital systems dealing only in true or false supposed to handle it? Computers have to represent time in binary (1’s and 0’s), which takes up room in memory.

32-bit systems represent the time in seconds as a string of 32 1’s and 0’s, giving 4,294,967,295 different values in 4GB of memory. In reality they don’t have that many separate combinations available for time-keeping, because the actual values range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

These systems consider Jan 1st 1970 to be the beginning of time — they began counting from zero which only takes them up to 03:14:07 on 19th Jan 2038. At this point they reach the magic number of available combinations and will start counting from -2,147,483,647 back towards 0.

Computers, smart as they are, won’t be able to tell you whether it’s 1970 or 2038; they simply won’t know the difference.

While a certain Kardashian is credited with breaking the internet using only her bare behind, the honour of breaking YouTube surely goes to Korean musical sensation PSY. His hit Gangnam Style had so many views on the platform that when the counter reached 2,147,483,647 and couldn’t go any higher, the resulting ‘integer overflow’ saw the counter numbers simply spin round and round when you hovered over it.

#### Is this the same problem as the Millenium Bug?

No. Computers then were also going to run out of memory, but they had a lot less of it in the first place. The first desktop computers were using 16-bit processors (the really important bit that allows programs to run) with 64kb of memory.

When they were built, memory was expensive, so to save space programmers used 2 digit placeholders instead of 4 digits for the year portion of dates. 1978 became 78, 1999 was persisted as 99….(you can probably see where this going)…the year 2000 was going to look no different to the computer than 1900.

#### So how bad is it…?

I’ve seen it referred to as the 'clockopalypse’, but will it bring about the end of the world?? It depends who you ask.

For most of us, the worst we will see is the wrong date on our computer. The fix is relatively simple in most cases — the systems just need to recompiled/upgraded to 64-bit, which was YouTube’s solution to the problem with the counter (they later said it was a joke and had been fixed months before).

For embedded systems it’s a little more involved because they can’t necessarily be upgraded simply by recompiling, instead they might need to be completely replaced, so the process needs to start in plenty of time. Embedded systems are utilised mostly in long-lived applications such as infrastructure, transportation, stability control, connected cars and IOT (Internet Of Things) devices. Any dependent systems or devices, databases etc also need to be considered.

#### Will this happen again?

A comment on an article on howstuffworks.com pointed out that IBM PC hardware suffers from the Year 2116 problem. They also count in 32-bit combinations, similarly to UNIX time, but for them the beginning of time starts at January 1, 1980 so their integer overflow will happen in 2116.

Most computers available today and even some smartphones and tablets are already based on 64-bit processors and software . Their maximum number of unique values is 18 quintillion, stored in 16 [Exabytes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte) of memory, so they are unlikely to fail for something like 292 billion years.
